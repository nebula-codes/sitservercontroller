SIT Game Server Controller

Website made to monitor and control your SIT game server

Installation Process:

- Unzip release folder
- Add your current game server files in the GameServer folder
- Edit appsettings.json BackendServerURL if you have your server listening to a specific IP Address
- (Optional) Edit appsettings.json AdminUsername and AdminPassword to your actual in-game user
- (**VERY IMPORTANT**) Create a shortcut of your Aki.Server.Exe simply called "Lol" and put it in the same directory as your Aki.Server.exe file (No this is not a joke, this is one of the weird issues I have at the moment lol)
- Run the SitServerController.exe and connect using the IP:Port shown in the terminal
